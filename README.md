This Github houses the demos and visualizations for the upcoming JCISE sumbission "Agentic Selection of Valid Multi-Fidelity Models"

Scripts that generated examples for the paper are housed in Figures.

A demonstration of the pathfinding abilities of this methodology are visualized in the visualized_demos section. 

This demo uses capabilities that are established in ConstraintHG (https://github.com/jmorris335/ConstraintHg) with some algorthmic tweaks specifically to handle syntactic variants.
